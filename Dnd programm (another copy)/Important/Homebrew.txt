Homebrew in D&D refers to custom content created by players for the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) role-playing game.
It includes races, classes, feats, magic items, and even entire campaigns that are not found in the official rulebooks.
Homebrew content allows players to personalize their gaming experience and add unique elements to their DND campaigns.
Players can create their own homebrew content or explore and use homebrew content created by others.
It provides a way to expand and customize the game beyond the standard rules and settings.
